/**explaining the processs : making the navigation bar by a function to execute a block of code by getting a loop for every section got by the query Selector,
 *  then making a list element and then an anchor then setting the name of the link based on the data_nav(the nav can be replaced but replace it in the code as well)
 * after that we make a href and add a class to the link(anchor) after that we make the list as a parent
 *  and the anchor as the child then the list will be the child of the doc. frag. 
 * and lastly we just add the Doc.Frag. as a child of the navigation bar that we fetched by ID.
 * then we added an event listner which waits till you input a certain thing to execute something 
 * so in my case on click on the section name from the nav bar and after preventing the default action to happen, it scrolls into the section smoothly.

/** here on scroll (found it in w3schools) and the tutor at discourse helped me
 * so we make a loop that for every section of the section in the navSection query we are gonna do the next
 * make a viewedpart variable that uses the getboundingclient to tell what the viewer is watching now
 * and then another variable for the links which gets the list elements
 *  (the discourse tutor really helped me in this part especially that I was choosing anchor elemnt <a>)
 * then I made a loop for each (because adding the youractiveclass didn't work in the main loop so I tried to make it like this)
 * so the prarameter is viewedNow which means what the user is gonna be watching on their screen and
 *  made an if conditional that if the parameter is in the area of 200 or less and more than the -300 
 * then it would add a new class and if not then it would remove it 
 * (i know the code looks big but I usually fix what I am doing by making a new function just seems easier)
 * and where if the viewedpart where I  made a variable holding the getboundingclient (but was lazy to change the upper code)
 *  and I made another loop and then said that it should remove the class active if it was there and then see if the link content is the same as the dataNav
 * (you can see it in the browser just see the navBar I used it to name the sections in the nvaigation as well) then it would add the class active
